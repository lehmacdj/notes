# Number Theory
+ Why
    + Encryption and privacy
+ Prime numbers
    + Euclid's proof of infinitude of primes
        + suppose there is a finite number of primes
        + then there is a largest prime, p
        + consider n = (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ... * p) + 1
        + n cannot be prime
        + therefore it has a prime divisor
        + but no number form 2 to p divides n
        + so n has a prime divisor greater than p
        + contradiction therefore this postulate must be fault

# Graph Theory
+ Bridges of Königsberg
    + Find path without crossing any bridge more than once but visit everything
    + Thinking about the problem as a graph leads to a simpler solution
    + Allows proof that it is impossible to survey the bridges in that way
    + having an odd number of bridges to each landmass makes this impossible
