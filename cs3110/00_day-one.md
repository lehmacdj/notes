# CS 3110

## Special Focuses
+ Cyber physical systems is the major focus for the year
    + Internet of things
+ Geometric algorithms

## Course Summary
+ functions and processes as data
+ recursions as control
+ data types and type theory
+ OCaml theory of computing
+ asynchronous computation
+ analysis of algorithms
    + asymptotic complexity
    + robustness

## Key figures in functional programming
+ Alonzo Church - Invented lambda calculus
+ Haskell Curry - S and K combinators

## Why OCaml
+ Proof assistant - Coq makes sure that programs are correct
+ ML Dialects
    + ML - First one
    + Classic ML
    + Standard ML
        + SML
    + OCaml
+ OCaml is the most popular ml dialect
+ Professor's colleagues like OCaml

## Structured Operational Semantics
+ Typeless evaluation system
+ integers
    + infinite precision
    + mathematical properties are correct
+ functions

```ocaml
Identity function
fun x -> x          
In lambda calculus: Î»x.x

Square function
fun x -> x * x
```

+ Eager evaluation
    + always evaluate arguments first
+ Lazy evaluation
    + apply function first
