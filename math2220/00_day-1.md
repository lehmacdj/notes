# Linear Algebra
+ Basically all of linear algebra.

## Vectors
1. vectors written as capital letter
2. norm of vector
3. dot product of vectors
    + Basically work F . S = work
    + By integrating we can deal with more complicated values for F and S, paths
      and forces that are not constant
4. Important inequalities
    1. Triangle inequality
        + || U + V || ≤ || U || + || V ||
    2. Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
        + | U . V | ≤ || U || * || V ||

### From C-S inequality
+ we can define what we mean by the angle θ, between two vectors in R^n
+ θ = cos^-1 ( (U . V) / (||U|| ||V||) )

## Matrices
+ | det M | = volume of the box
+  Cross product
    + Properties:
        1. V x W = W x V
        2. V . (V x W) = 0 and W . (V x W) = 0
    + perpendicular to V and W
    + length is the area of the parallelogram formed by v and w
    + derivable from matrix determinant
+ Triple scalar product
    + u . (v x w)
    + flux
