#Hierarch and inheritance
+ every class extends object
+ a extends b only if a "is a" b
+ Important classes in object:
    + String toString()
    + boolean equals()

##Overriding
+ implement the method in the subclass

##this keyword
+ refers to the current object
+ java checks stuff in order of declaration
    + inside out rule
+ fields are shadowed if they are redeclared

##static keyword
+ only one copy of the method exists
    + it is not in each object
+ can be called like so: O.method();

###Singleton pattern
+ only one Singleton can ever exist
