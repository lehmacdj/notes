# Kinetics
+ Reaction rates are dependent on the various factors
+ If there are multiple reactions only the slowest one affects the rate of the reaction

## Catalysts
+ Accelerate the reaction rate by removing the slowest rate defining step
+ decreases the maximum âˆ†G needed for the reaction
    + reduces the reaction barrier
