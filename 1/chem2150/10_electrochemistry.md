#Electrochemistry
+ Consider the following reaction:
+ Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) -> Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
    + copper reduced
    + zinc oxidized

## Oxidation Number
+ The amount of positive that an ion is
+ if the oxidation number increases a compound is oxidized
+ oxidation states sum to zero

## The photoelectric effect
+ when light bounces off of metal some electrons bounce off

## Terminology
***L***oss of

***E***lectrons

***O***xidation @

***N***egavive Electrode

***A***node (anions move towards it)

***G***ain of 

***E***lectrons is

***R***eduction @

***P***ositive Electrode

***C***athode (Cations move towards it)

**LEONA the lioness says GERPCa**

## Energy
```
Energy = Charge * Voltage
       = q E = - qe E
```

## Drawing the reaction
```
Zn(s) | ZnSO4(aq) || CuSO4(aq) | Cu(s)
      ^           ^            ^
      |     The salt bridge    | 
      |                        | 
      |                        | 
means that there are distinct phases in contact

## Free lunch
+ much more efficient than engines
+ CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O
    + C's oxidation state -4 -> + 4
    + O's 0 -> -2 

## Oxidation states
+ the sum of the oxidation states is the charge on the molecule
+ elements have a oxidation state of 0
+ Things on the column 1 ( alkali metals ) always want to be
+ {Be, Mg, .. Ra; Zn, Cd } always + 2
+ H
    + +1 with nonmetals
    + -1 with metals
+ O
    + Usually -2
    + sometimes -1
+ Halogens 
    + -1
    + when bonded with more electronegative thing +1 (only halogens)
+ main group
    + 1. draw lewis structure
    + xfer <- to most
