#Energy and Pressure-Volume Work
##Energy
+ Energy depends on:
    + V
    + T
    + number of particles
    + arrangement of atoms
+ Energy is a function of state

##Work
###Scenario
+ A movable piston extends
+ Work = External Force x Distance
+ work done on the gas

###Proof
```
W = Pext (x2 - x1) = Pext/A * A(x2-x1)
    Pext / A } external pressure
    A(x2 -x1) } volume change

W = Pext * ∆V

dw = -Pext (X) dv

Total Work:
     v2
w = -∫ Pext (X) dV
     v1
```

##Work, Heat, and Energy
+ a piston cycles following different paths ot get to the starting point
+ ∆U = 0 for the cycle
    + as long as the path is a closed loop
