#Energy and Pressure-Volume Work
##Energy
+ Energy depends on:
    + V
    + T
    + number of particles
    + arrangement of atoms
+ Energy is a function of state

##Work
###Scenario
+ A movable piston extends
+ Work = External Force x Distance
+ work done on the gas

###Proof
```
W = Pext (x2 - x1) = Pext/A * A(x2-x1)
    Pext / A } external pressure
    A(x2 -x1) } volume change

W = Pext * ∆V

dw = -Pext (X) dv

Total Work:
     v2
w = -∫ Pext (X) dV
     v1
```

##Work, Heat, and Energy
+ a piston cycles following different paths ot get to the starting point
+ Pressure vs Volume Curve
+ ∆U = 0 for the cycle
    + as long as the path is a closed loop

             | Depends on  | state func? 
-------------|-------------|------------
Energy (U)   | V, T, Atoms | Yes
P-V Work (W) | P, V        | No

+ ∆U = q + W
    + ∆U is path independent
    + q is path dependent
    + W is path dependent

###Measuring ∆U
+ Constant Volume
```
         V2
∆U = q - ∫ P(V) dV 
         V1

=>  ∆U = qv } if there is constant volume
```
+ normally constant volume is not used
+ instead P is constant

##Enthalpy
+ H = U + PV
    + H Depends on P and T
    + state function
```
∆H = ∆U + ∆(PV)
with constant P
∆H = q + w + P∆V
since w = -P∆V
the terms cancel and we get:
∆H = qp
```
+ ∆H˚rxn = -110.5 kJ/mol
    + ˚ } standard state 1 atm and 25˚C
