#Acids and Bases
+ gets its own chapter because of water
2H2O ⇌ H3O+ + OH-

##Brønsted Lowry acid bases
+ proton donor = acid
+ proton acceptor = base

##Lewis Acids and Bases
+ Lewis acids accept electrons
+ Lewis bases donate electrons
    + Bases have free electron pairs to form new bonds with other things
+ This defination leads to being applicable to forming acids and bases with other things

####Hydrogen Flouride (random aside)
+ a very dangerous compound despite the fact that it is a weak acid

##Strong acid and strong base
+ completely discociate

##pH
+ Water disociates and forms H3O+ and OH-
    + Therefore water is amphoteric because it can be both a acid and a base
    + this is called a disproportionation reaction
+ Kw = [OH-][H3O+] = 1.0 * 10^-14
+ [H3O] = [OH-] = 1 * 10^-7 M
+ pH is defined as -log10([H3O+]/1M)
+ pOH is defined as -log10([OH-]/1M)
+ pKw = 14
+ pH + pOH = pKw = 14 | T = 25˚C

## Measuring pH
### using a pH meter
+ give a grange from 1 to 10^-14

### chemical indicator
+ has several lone pairs and several configurations to choose from
+ this leads to several different colors
+ at differnt pHs the color of the indicator changes
+ indicators often have methyl group

## Buffers
+ Two components
    + a weak acid
    + the salt of a weak acid
