#Spontaneaity
+ If the ∆S of the universe is < 0 Won't happen Heat flow cold -> Hot
+ If the ∆S of the universe = 0 the reaction is at equilibrium
+ If the ∆S of the universe > 0 the reaction will proceed spontaneously

##Gibbs free energy
+ ∆Ssurr = ∆Hsurr/T = -∆Hsys/T
+ ∆Suniv = ∆Ssys = ∆Ssurr > 0 = ∆Ssys - ∆Hsys/T ≥ 0
+ ∆G ≣ ∆H - T∆S ≤ 0
    + this is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics
+ **make sure when calculating ∆G that the units for entropy and enthalpoy are the same units**

###Conclusions from the gibbs free energy
+ ∆G > 0 Won't Happen
+ ∆G = 0 Equilibrium
+ ∆G < 0 Spontaneous

###The amount of ∆G matters
+ The system adjusts until the ∆G for the system is equal to zero

###Alternate representation of the ∆G
```
G(P,T,n) = H - TS = U + PV - TS
∂G/∂P | T,n = V -> dG = dP @ const T,n
dG = nRT * 1/P * dP
more proof...
G(P) - G˚ = nRT(lnP - lnP˚)
```
+ This leads to the conclusion that G(P) - G˚ = nRT ln(P/P˚) 
+ per mole this is equal to G / n written as Ḡ

##The Equilibrium Constant
+ the equilibrum constant follows from the lg part of the gibbs free energy reaction

```
PBeq * P˚
-------  = e^(-∆G˚/RT) = Keq(T)
PAeq^2
```
+ P˚ is the pressure that ∆G˚ was measured at
