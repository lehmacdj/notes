#Spontaneaity
+ If the ∆S of the universe is < 0 Won't happen Heat flow cold -> Hot
+ If the ∆S of the universe = 0 the reaction is at equilibrium
+ If the ∆S of the universe > 0 the reaction will proceed spontaneously

##Gibbs free energy
+ ∆Ssurr = ∆Hsurr/T = -∆Hsys/T
+ ∆Suniv = ∆Ssys = ∆Ssurr > 0 = ∆Ssys - ∆Hsys/T ≥ 0
+ ∆G ≣ ∆H - T∆S ≤ 0
    + this is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics
+ **make sure when calculating ∆G that the units for entropy and enthalpoy are the same**

###Conclusions from the gibbs free energy
+ ∆G > 0 Won't Happen
+ ∆G = 0 Equilibrium
+ ∆G < 0 Spontaneous

###The amount of ∆G matters
+ The system adjusts until the ∆G for the system is equal to zero

###Alternate representation of the ∆G
```
G(P,T,n) = H - TS = U + PV - TS
∂G/∂P | T,n = V -> dG = dP @ const T,n
dG = nRT * 1/P * dP

[Finish here next class]
```
+ This leads to the conclusion that G(P) - G˚ = nRT(lnP - lnP˚)
