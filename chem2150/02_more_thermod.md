#More thermo

+ Conservation of energy
+ In reality energy is lost to friction

##Thought Experiments
###Experiment 1

+ fixed volume
+ Reaction of 2H2 and O2
+ surrounded with water
+ for good thermal conduct

+ fuse is lit

+ forms 2H20
+ heat is transfered to the water q1

###Experiment 2

+ same but with vacuum instead of water
+ variable volume
+ no thermal conduct
+ piston with a constant fixed force

+ fuse is lit

+ forms 2H20
+ volume expands
+ no heat is transfered
+ the piston can do work = W2

###Experiment 3

+ mixed experiment
+ good thermal conduct
+ expandable volume

+ some heat transfered = q3
+ some work done = W3

###Observation
+ q1 = W2 = q3 + W3

+ Ansatz -- fancy german word for guess

âˆ†U = Uf - Ui = q + W
