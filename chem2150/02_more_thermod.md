#More thermo

+ Conservation of energy
+ In reality energy is lost to friction

##Experiment 1

+ fixed volume
+ Reaction of 2H2 and O2
+ surrounded with water
+ for good thermal conduct

+ fuse is lit

+ forms 2H20
+ heat is transfered to the water

##Experiment 2

+ same but with vacuum instead of water
+ variable volume
+ no thermal conduct
+ piston with a constant fixed force

+ fuse is lit

+ forms 2H20
+ volume expands
+ no heat is transfered
+ the piston can do work

##Experiment 3

+ mixed experiment
+ good thermal conduct
+ expandable volume
