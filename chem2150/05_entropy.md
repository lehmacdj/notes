#Entropy
##Per bond enthalpy
+ add together the energy of all of the bonds
+ written like H(C-H) = 104 kJ/mol
+ positive but has a negative enthalpy
+ bond energies are not always exactly the same
    + therefore not very accurate
    + at most Â±5% accurate
    + therefore shouldn't be trusted hightly
