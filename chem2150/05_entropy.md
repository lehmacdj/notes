#Entropy
##Per bond enthalpy
+ add together the energy of all of the bonds
+ written like H(C-H) = 104 kJ/mol
+ positive but has a negative enthalpy
+ bond energies are not always exactly the same
    + therefore not very accurate
    + at most ±5% accurate
    + therefore shouldn't be trusted hightly

##Some basic thinking
+ it is easy to think that only exothermic reactions will react
+ howerver that is not always true
+ sometimes endothermic reactions are spontaneous

##Definition
+ It is a state function

```
   final
∆S = ∫ dqrev / T
  initial
} dqrev = dq reversible
```

+ has units of J/K

###Cases
####Isothermal
```
      1  final
∆S = --- ∫ dqrev = qrev / T
      T  init
qrev = -w
∆S -= nRln(V2/V1)
constant temperature
volume increases
∴ entropy increases
```

####Adiabadic
```
qrev = 0
∴ ∆S = 0
```

####Constant pressure or volume
```
c = 1/n ∂q/∂T
dqrev = n C dT
} C: molar heat capacity
    final         final         T2
∆S = ∫ dqrev / T = ∫ nCdT/T = nC ∫ dT/T
    initial       init          T1
positive
∆S = nC ln(T2/T1)
with constant P or V
temperature increases
∴ entropy increases
```

####Reversable vs Irreversable
qrev > qirrev
