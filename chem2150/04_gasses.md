# Gasses

## Kinetic Gas Model
+ **u** is the velocity vector of the gas
+ collisions are perfectly elastic
    + all velocity components are mirrored by surface that they collide with
+ force on the wall

```
F-x = change of momentum / collision * collisions / time
F-x = 2m * ux * 1/2 ux * A * N / V = m * ux^2 * A * N / V
F-x/A * V = N m * ux^2
} F-x/A = P
} n * NA * kB * T = N kg * T
P * V = nRT
