# Solubility
## Solubility Product
+ equilibrium like
+ AgCl(s) <=> Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
+ Ksp = [Ag+(aq)][Cl-(aq)]

## Selective Precipitation
### The common ion effect
+ Precipitation occurs much more frequently when there is excess ions of one variety in the solution

### Electrochem
+ all nitrates are soluble but not all chlorides are soluble
