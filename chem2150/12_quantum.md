# Quantum Mechanics
## Particles
+ localized
+ have mass
+ have velocity

## Waves
+ velocity
+ extended in space
+ frequency wavelength

### Standing waves
+ like a musical instrument
+ oscilates up and down
+ wavelength = Full length of L

### Travelling waves
+ moves in a direction
+ has a wavelength
+ frequency * wavelength = speed

#### Ocean wave
+ water
+ pushes boats surfers etc
+ energy = amplitude

# Light
+ electric field E and magnetic field B
+ changes electrons and protons
+ energy depends

## Types of light
+ radio - mri, nmr
+ microwaves - molecule rotations bonds vibrate
+ infra-red - bonds vibrate electrons move
+ visible onward - moves electrons

## Photoelectric effect
+ when light strikes metal electrons fly off

## Properties
+ Light is like a particle
+ but also like a wave

### X-Ray Difraction
+ X-rays bounce off the atoms in a way to get constructive and destructive interference
+ peaks @ special thetas
+ theta = arcsin(n * lambda / 2 * d) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    + where:
    + lambda = x-ray wavelength
    + d = atom spacing

### Electron difraction
+ Electrons can have the same consequence
+ electrons behave as waves as well

## Particles as waves

### Debroglie equation
+ describes the wavelength of a particle
+ lambda = h/P = h/mv
    + where:
    + h = plank's constant
    + P is momentum
    + m = mass
    + v = velocity
+ applies to all kinsds of the particles
+ the larger the mass of the object the smaller the wavelength
+ if the wavelength is larger than the particle it behaves more like a wave
+ otherwise it behaves more like a particle

### Bohr's Model
+ The electron is rotating around the nucleus and the coulomb force pulls the atom in
+ Balancing forces: centripidal and coulomb forces are equal
    + mv^2/r = 1/(4pieo) * e^2/r
+ Bohr postulate: Angular momentum is quantized
    + L = mvr = nh/2pi

### Emisssion spectra
+ hnulight = -Rh(1/m^2 - 1/n^2)
    + where Rh = me^4/8e0^2h^2 or Rydberg's constant
    + hnulight is the energy of the list emited

### SchrÃ¶dinger's Equation
+ Hugely complicated
+ Basically the kinetic energy + hte potential energy
+ E is actually all of the allowed energy
+ There are multiple wavefunctions that all satisfy the wave function
+ psi(x, y, z) => complex number
    + drawing the wave function is complicated
