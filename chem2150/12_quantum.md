# Quantum Mechanics
## Particles
+ localized
+ have mass
+ have velocity

## Waves
+ velocity
+ extended in space
+ frequency wavelength

### Standing waves
+ like a musical instrument
+ oscilates up and down
+ wavelength = Full length of L

### Travelling waves
+ moves in a direction
+ has a wavelength
+ frequency * wavelength = speed

#### Ocean wave
+ water
+ pushes boats surfers etc
+ energy = amplitude

# Light
+ electric field E and magnetic field B
+ changes electrons and protons
+ energy depends

## Types of light
+ radio - mri, nmr
+ microwaves - molecule rotations bonds vibrate
+ infra-red - bonds vibrate electrons move
+ visible onward - moves electrons

## Photoelectric effect
+ when light strikes metal electrons fly off

## Properties
+ Light is like a particle
+ but also like a wave

### X-Ray Difraction
+ X-rays bounce off the atoms in a way to get constructive and destructive interference
