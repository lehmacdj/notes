#Energy and Pressure-Volume Work
##Energy
+ Energy depends on:
    + V
    + T
    + number of particles
    + arrangement of atoms
+ Energy is a function of state

##Work
###Scenario
+ A movable piston extends
+ Work = External Force x Distance
+ work done on the gas

###Proof
```
W = Pext (x2 - x1) = Pext/A * A(x2-x1)
    Pext / A } external pressure
    A(x2 -x1) } volume change

W = Pext * ∆V

dw = -Pext (X) dv

Total Work:
     v2
w = -∫ Pext (X) dV
     v1
```

##Work, Heat, and Energy
+ a piston cycles following different paths ot get to the starting point
+ Pressure vs Volume Curve
+ ∆U = 0 for the cycle
    + as long as the path is a closed loop

             | Depends on  | state func? 
-------------|-------------|------------
Energy (U)   | V, T, Atoms | Yes
P-V Work (W) | P, V        | No

+ ∆U = q + W
    + ∆U is path independent
    + q is path dependent
    + W is path dependent

###Measuring ∆U
+ Constant Volume
```
         V2
∆U = q - ∫ P(V) dV 
         V1

=>  ∆U = qv } if there is constant volume
```
+ normally constant volume is not used
+ instead P is constant
+ sign is negative if work is done on the gas

##Enthalpy
+ H = U + PV
    + H Depends on P and T
    + state function
```
∆H = ∆U + ∆(PV)
with constant P
∆H = q + w + P∆V
since w = -P∆V
the terms cancel and we get:
∆H = qp
```
+ ∆H˚rxn = -110.5 kJ/mol
    + ˚ } standard state 1 atm and 25˚C
+ ∆H = Uproducts - Ureactants
    + Solids can be neglected because they are very small
    + "a fart in a windstorm"
+ ∆H is...
    + negative for exothermic reactions -- heat is released by the reaction
    + positive for endothermic reactions -- heat is absorbed by the reaction

###Enthapy rules 
1. standard state -- all reactions are measured at one bar and 25˚C
2. more stuff, more enthalpy
    + multiplying and dividing of reactions and such
    + be careful what the actual reaction is
3. reverse reaction reverse the sign
###Hess's Law
+ reactions can be added:
    + you then add the enthalpies to get the new enthalpy of the reaction

###Heat of formation reactions
+ reactions that are used as the basis for predicting other reactions
+ reactions of things in standard state to form compounds
    + example reaction: 
        + 2Fe(s) + 3/2O2 -> 1Fe2O3 ∆H˚f = -820 kJ/mol
        + 2Al + 3/2O2 -> 12Al2O3 ∆H˚f = -1670 kJ/mol
+ Generalizing the equation
    + ∆H˚rxn = ∑ np ∆H˚p - ∑ nr ∆H˚r

###Heat capacity (Cp)
+ Cp = ∂gp/∂T -> per mole Cp = 1/n * 2gp/2T [J/mol*K] or [J/mol*˚C] = 1/n * ∆H/∆T
    + at constant pressure

###Calculating Temperature
+ ∆T = ∆H/n*Cp
    + Cp } in general you just look up Cp or it can be measured
