# Phases - The thermodynamics of phases
## Pressure vs Temperature
+ as pressure increases the amount of temperature required to change state is increases

## q vs T
+ at a phase transition this graph levels off as the phase transition occurs
+ solid to liquid = ∆Hfusion, ∆Sfusion
   + ∆Sfusion = ∆Hfusion/Tm 
+ liquid to gas = ∆Hvapor, ∆Svapor
   + ∆Svapor = ∆Hvapor/Te
+ at thte phase transitions the two phases coexist while the transition occurs

## Troutons's Rule
+ the ∆Svap of Ar, H2O and Cu ~= 85

##Phase diagrams
+ Triple point - a point at which all three phases exist
+ Phase transition boundaries - show points where two phases coexist
+ Critical point - a temperature past which liquid can not really exist

## l to g boundary
```
∂P/∂T = (Sg - Sl)/(Vg-Vl)
∆Svap = Sg - Sl = ∆Hvap/T

dP/dT = ∆Hvap/T * 1/∆Vvap
this is exact for any temperature
```

## Supercriticalness
+ Ideal gas law predicts that there is no phase transition
+ Past super critical point there is no phase transition
+ Supercritical point is a certain temperature

##Solid to Liquid boundary
```
p      ∆Hmelt    T
∫dP' = ------- * ∫ dT'/T
p*     ∆Vmelt    T*

assume that ∆Hmelt, ∆Vmelt are independent of P and T

         ∆Hmelt    ( T )
P = P* + ------- ln(---)
         ∆Vmelt    ( T*)
```

##Liquid to gas boundary
```
∆Vvap = Vgas = RT/P = V/n

substitute


dP   ∆Hvap    P
-- = ----- * ---
dT     R     T^2

P                   T
∫dP'/P' = ∆Hvap/R * ∫dT'/T'^2
P*                  T*

P(T) = P*exp(∆Hvap/R * (1/T* - 1/T))

```

##Solid to gas boundary
+ is very similar to the liquid to gas boundary
