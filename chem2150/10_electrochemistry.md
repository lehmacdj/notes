#Electrochemistry
+ Consider the following reaction:
+ Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) -> Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
    + copper reduced
    + zinc oxidized

## Oxidation Number
+ The amount of positive that an ion is
+ if the oxidation number increases a compound is oxidized

## The photoelectric effect
+ when light bounces off of metal some electrons bounce off

## Terminology
***L***oss of

***E***lectrons

***O***xidation @

***N***egavive Electrode

***A***node (anions move towards it)

***G***ain of 

***E***lectrons is

## Energy
```
Energy = Charge * Voltage
       = q E = - qe E
```

## Drawing the reaction
```
Zn(s) | ZnSO4(aq) || CuSO4(aq) | Cu(s)
