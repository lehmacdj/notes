# Homeothermic creatures

## Benefits and Costs

### Benefits
+ Ability to live in a wider range of habitats
+ Chemical efficiency
+ Activity levels can be kept higher
    + more active at night - etc.
    + Flying

### Costs
+ Metabolic cost to being in an environment where T_a is greater than T_b
    + T_a is ambient temperature
+ Need for sensors / ability to sense changes in temperatures
+ Endotherms have a metabolic rate about 100 times higher than that of normal
  ectotherms

#### Affected by T_a
+ Thermoregulating creatures have a range when their BMR is most stable
    + This is called their *Thermoneutral zone*
    + Above this more energy is needed to sweat
    + Below this more energy is needed for sweating etc.
+ C is a constant such that C (T_b - T_a)

#### Regulating T_b
+ T_b is an internal set point
+ is monitored by the "thermostat" in hypothalmus
+ This is a negative feedback
    + Heat loss or increase is changed until enough heat is generated and then
      the changes are reversed
    + Similarly for decreased temperature

#### Shivering Thermogenesis
+ co-contraction of opposing muscles that are opposing each other
+ No mechanical work do to co-activation

#### Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST)
+ Brown adipose tissue (BAT) generates heat
+ Exists in small quantities at some spots
+ This tissue helps regulate the temperature of the substance

##### Mechanism for NST in BAT
+ Protons are shuttled across the membrane producing heat but no energy
+ Produced through thermochemistry
+ Thermogenin is a special channel in brown muscles in NST

#### Resetting the thermocycle
+ Sleep / Wakefulness - adjsts set point diurnally
+ Hibernation - adjusts the temperature seasonally
+ Fever - adjusts temperature sporadically by pyrogens
    + Exogenous (e.g., bacterial lipopolysaccharides)
    + Endogenous (cytokynenes etc.)

##### More on hibernation
+ The temperature decreases outside
+ creatures go through cycles

#### Regional heterothermy
+ counter current heat exchange keeps heat at the core of a creature
+ The heat of a creature is colder in the appendages due to a larger surface
  area to volume ratio
