# The circulatory system

## Size isn't everything
+ with great size comes great need to expel waste more quickly
+ for small organisms (e.g. single cellular) organisms diffusion is sufficient

## Vertebrates
+ In vertebrates the respiratory and circulatory systems are very linked

### EG
+ Fish: atrium -> ventricle -> gills -> body -> atrium
    + single circulation
+ Amphibians, reptiles, mammals -> ever increasing amount of separation of
  circulatory and respiratory systems to two closed loops.

### Mammalian heart
+ Atrium: where blood enters
+ Ventricle: where blood leaves
+ Right Ventricle - sends stuff to the lungs
+ Left Ventricle - sends stuff to the
+ Right atrium / ventricle always pumps before left

### Regulation of the heart
+ The cardiac muscles in the heart behave somewhat like neurons
+ Atria are coupled with one another
+ Ventricles are also coupled with one another

## SA (Sinoatrial) Cells
+ Have voltage gated and leaky channels and voltage gated channels

1. Na+ slowly leaks in
2. Voltage gated Ca2+ channel opens
3. Voltage gated K+ channels open

## Ventricular Muscle action potential
1. Voltage gated Na+ channels open
2. Voltage gated Ca2+ channels open
3. Voltage gated K+ channels open

## AV node
+ Transfers signal from the atria to the ventricles

## Pacemakers
+ These fulfill the same purpose as the SA Cells
+ Also helps fulfill the purpose of the SA node

## Neural modulation of the heart rate
+ Most creatures hearts beat myogenically (muscle causes the rhythm)
+ In humans: about 90 - 100 bpm
+ Fight or Flight: speed up the heart rate
+ Rest and Digest: acetocholine decreases the heart rate

## Acetocholine and the heart
+ First neurotransmitter discovered in 1926
    + Otto Loewi
+ more on lewees experiment in notes on the site
 
 + Acetocholine + norepinephrine changing the rhythm
