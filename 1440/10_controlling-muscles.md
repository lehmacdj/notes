# Controlling the Motion of Muscles

## Muscle proprioceptors
+ Muscle spindle organs are sensorimotor organs
    + Stretch sensitive (Send to CNS)
    + Muscles ("intrafusal fibers") innervated by gamma motor neurons
+ Linear response to stretch

## Reflexes
+ Bypasses central nervous system
+ A reaction that bypasses the neurotransmitter

### Simple
+ Extension reflex
    + Stretch reflex -> extension
    + spindle organ is very coupled with the motor neuron
    + Leads instantly to response to stretch
    + Linear response

### Complex
+ Flexion reflex (withdrawal reflex)
    + Excitation
        1. Receptor
        2. sensory neuron
        3. Spinal interneuron
        4. Î± motor neuron
        5. flexor muscle
    + Inhibition
        1. Sensory neuron
        2. spinal interneuron
        3. interneuron
    + Helps you stay standing
    + also works in arms because of our origins as 4 legged mammals

### Why?
+ Typically has survival value
+ Regulated by Mauthner neurons
    + A named neuron
    + Some neurons have names because people decided to give them names
    + Easily identifiable in most animals

### Abusing reflexes
+ A predatory water snake is able to abuse reflex of fish being startled which
  leads to the fish being brutally being eaten
+ This is also a simple muscle memory reflex

## Voluntary acts (Muscle motions created by human actions)
+ Muscle spindles become inactive when doing a voluntary act
+ When muscle contracts the muscle spindle doesn't become sensitive most of the
  time because the spindle is also contracted
+ This leads to both muscles being the same length

## Rhythm / Complex activities
1. Mechanism 1
    + alternating activation of antagonistic muscles
    + some processors must generate cyclic behavior
2. Mechanism 2
    + More common
    + May contain oscillatory cells
    + Rhythmic activity is generated by a network of cells
    + Result is more stable
    + CNS can mostly produce rhythmic motions but the sensors are needed to keep
      the thing correctly
    + Without central input this will only work if they are on a moving surface
