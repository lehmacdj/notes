# Sensing things

## Chemical Senses

### Smell
+ Olfactory receptor cells are neurons (not epithelial cells) receptors are
  G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
    + These are proteins in the membrane that lead to different things in the
      cell
    + Each cell only has one type
    + There are redundant types of cells
+ Easy to recognize in genomes because they are caused by proteins

### Taste
+ 5 primary tastes, receptors are cells that detect a single taste type
    + Grow back every day or so
+ Very similar to smell
+ Sweet, umami, bitter
    + G Protein coupled receptor different mechanism to send charge another
      cell.
+ Salty
    + A protein receptor
    + Sends stuff to neurons through a synapse
+ Sour
    + TRP Channel
    + Otherwise unknown

## Photoreception
+ Most studied in other classes
+ Rods cones
+ Light passes through a ton of stuff to show up at the rods and cones
    + These are GPCRs (named opsin)
    + Vitamin A is attached.
    + When light strikes vitamin A (Z) interconverts with (E) conformation of
      vitamin A
    + This leads to the activation of the channel

##### Vertabrates vs Invertabrates
+ invertabrates, channels open and current is turned on by light
+ vertabrates, channels close and current is turned off by light

##### Rods vs Cones
+ Rods are way more sensitive
+ Cones are less sensitive and exist in 3 types:
    + Respond to a range of wavelengths
    + S cone - blue
    + M cone - green
    + L cone - red
    + roughly...

## Hearing
+ Hairs are vibrated by sound pressure waves
+ Vibration depolarizes the cell when the tip link is disconnected
+ Hairs are anchored in the tentorial membrane in mammals
+ The magnitude is also measured
+ Magnitude is encoded in binary action potentials
