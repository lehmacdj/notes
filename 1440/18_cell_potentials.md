# Controlling Respiration
+ CO2 and H+ are the key regulators of ventilation
+ CO2 is toxic to the body

## O2 Levels and the control
+ A 25% decrease in O2 can lead to an increase in ventilation

## Proteins for transport of O2
+ Hemoglobin (Myoglobin in some organisms, i.e whales)
    + Together these two account for 98% of oxygen in blood
+ Hemoglobin binds O2 noncovalently
+ Hemoglobin binds cooperatively
    + One oxygen binding increases the probability that other things will bind
    + Also helps unloading, once one thing unloads more things unload due to
      cooperativity
        + This allows blood in capillaries still to have a concentration left
+ Myoglobin is also inside muscle cells O2 goes from Hemoglobin to myoglobin
  effectively
    + This allows more blood to make it to the muscles


### The Bohr Shift
+ Hemoglobin affinity is inversely proportional to CO2 and H+ concentration

### Temperature
+ Increasing temperature makes Hemoglobin bind less easily

### CO2 in blood
+ CO2 + H2O -> H+ + HCO3-
    + Converted to a bicarbonate
+ Only 5% is transported as bicarbonate

### Hemoglobin as Buffer
+ H+ binds to hemoglobin and helps keep the pH constant

### Haldane effect
+ The oxygenation of blood influences the CO2 equilibrium curve
    + Deoxygenation favors uptake (muscles)
    + Oxygenation increases unloading (lungs)
