# Temperature
+ What is it the speed of the random motion of atoms or molecules in a
  substance.
+ Heat is the total energy of the temperature of the entire object.
+ How do organisms acquire the heat that they have.

## Heat in organisms
+ T\_body = T\_ambient + H\_metabolism +/- H\_radiation +/- H\_conduction +/-
  H\_convection - H\_evaporation

### Metabolism
+ Metabolic heat is always gained due to inefficiency of biochemical reactions
+ Respiration is only 65% efficient.
+ Muscular conversion of ATP is less <30% efficient
+ With shivering more H\_met is produced as well.

+ Thus H\_met is created in the volume of the body but is transferred (lost)
  across a surface.
+ Therefore larger creatures are warmer
+ Surface area to volume ratio determines a lot about how the object interacts
  with the environment.

### Radiation
+ all objects with T â‰¥ 0 can radiate heat, and absorb heat
+ Everything glows in the dark (emits infra-red radiation)

### Conduction
+ Conduction is the transfer of heat through stationary materials by atomic
  molecular agitation.
+ Conduction is proportional to the difference in temperatures and the surface
  area of contact between the two objects
+ also depends on the thermal conductivity of the material
+ The thermal conductivity of metal is very high
+ Fur, fat, blubber etc. are very good insulators, i.e. have a low thermal
  conductivity measure.

### Convection
+ The transfer of heat between fluids and other objects in a system
+ The transfer of heat through a material mediated by macroscopic motion of the
  material (bulk flow).
+ Heat is carried from place to place by some kind of carrier.
+ Typically we mean air here.
+ There is a boundary layer near all things in the environment
+ This boundary layer does not change as much as the air outside of the boundary
  layer due to a lack of air flow.
+ By using a fan or raising above the hot desert floor a human or lizard can
  dispel this boundary layer and become more effectively cool
+ creatures can try to increase or decrease the conductive air flow

### Evaporation
+ Evaporation can decrease the temperature of a creature.
+ By sweating, when the water evaporates energy is lost and thus heat of the
  creature can be reduced
+ when bees get hot they regurgitate some nectar in order to produce
+ Evaporation immediately cools the body compared to the temperature increase of
  a dead bee.
+ When humidity is high evaporation is not a very effective way to cool down
  because the water can not evaporate

## Endotherms
+ "Inside temperature"
    + The temperature originates from within the body of the creature
+ T\_b is mostly metabolic
+ Thermo-regulating endotherms are usually called homeotherms
    + this includes most different birds and mammals
+ Some do not
    + e.g. naked mole rat

## Ectotherms
+ "Outside temperature"
    + The temperature originates mostly from the environment
+ T\_b is mostly environmental
+ Most are non regulating
    + Their temperature changes throughout the day etc.
+ Some ectotherms regulate their temperature behaviorally
    + thermoregulating ectotherms
    + behavioral thermo regulators

### Temperature regulating ectotherms
+ Evidence:
    + Lizards
        + Models passively exchange all components of the heat exchange equation
          except for H\_met
        + They have a wide range of temperatures when placed in an environment if
          the temperature is then measured
        + Real lizards have a much smaller temperature range of temperatures based
          on the environment
    + Bluefin tuna
        + They are inbetween completely conforming to the temperature of the
          environment and having a constant temperature
    + Bees
        + The abdomen is the same temperature of the environment
        + The rest of their body is way warmer, almost consistent with being a
          thermoregulator

### Gigantothermy
+ Big animals have a small surface area to volume ratio
+ Once they are warm they do not loose temperature quickly and effectively
  become and endotherm for the day and can regulate their body temperature
