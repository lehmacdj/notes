# Hormones
+ Signalling molecules
+ Regulate things like:
    + Morphogenesis / tissue development
        + sexual dimorphism
    + Cellular function
        + Blood glucose levels
    + Behaviors
        + Mating behaviors
        + Parental care

### Comparison with neurotransmitters
+ Neurotransmitters reach their target by simple diffusion
    + Only has to move across the synaptic cleft
+ Hormones are released into the circulatory and are distributed by bulk to a
  large percentage of the body

### Where do they come from?
+ Non-neural endocrine cells
+ Neurosecretory cells

### How are they accepted?
+ The cell needs specialized receptors to recieve them

## Definition of Hormones
+ *Source:* specialized secretory cells
+ *Transport:* through circulatory system
+ *Physiological role:* cellular regulators
+ *Relative effectiveness:* work at very low concentrations
+ *Concentration:* regulated
+ **Not defined by:** molecular composition

### Not everything in blood is a hormone
+ CO_2 can act as a signalling molecule
    + But it is not released by secretory cells
    + Also is found in high concentrations in blood

## Types of hormones
+ Steroids
    + Gonadal or sex hormones
+ Amines
    + Modified amino acids
    + e.g.
        + epinephrine
        + thyroid hormone
+ Peptide Hormones
    + effectively a whole protein
    + are processed to become the active form
    + e.g.
        + insulin

## Regulation of hormones

#### Points of regulation
+ secretory cell
    + production rate
    + release rate
+ degradation rate
    + enzymes / cells take hormones out of blood
+ target cell
    + receptor expression
    + receptor type and density
+ Pituitary Gland
    + behind hypothalamus
    + two parts
        + anterior
        + posterior

##### Posterior Pituitary is Source of two Hormones
+ Vasopressine (antidiuretic)
    + regulates blood pressure + urine production
    + neural feedback leads to release of vasopressin
        + Increases aquaporin density
        + Fixes low blood pressure
+ Oxytocin
    + Uterine contractions
    + Milk production
    + Social behavior
    + Modulates social behavior
        + oxytocin increases distance that pair bonded men maintain relative to
          unknown attractive women
+ Pituitary does not produce these hormones
    + Produced in hypothalamus

##### Anterior Pituitary Glan
+ Three regions *( no need to memorize these names )*
    + Pars tubueralis
    + Pars distalis
    + Pars intermedia
+ Hormones are synthesized in these structures by nonneural endocrine cells
+ Two classes of hormones:
    + Releasing hormones *trophins*
        + target other endocrine glands
            + Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): targets the thyroid gland
    + Growth hormones: promote growth of nonendocrine cells
        + Melanocyte stimulating hormone
+ Endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are regulated by hormones released
  by hypothalamus

###### Hypothalamus
+ Releases hormones to regulate the pituitary glands
+ Promoting and regulating hormones
+ Axis of control
    + a series of hormonal signals can be involved in production and secretion
      of endocrine signals

###### Hormones modulating hormones
+ Permissive: presence  of 1 is required for 2 to have any effect
+ Anatagonism: presence of 2 antagonizes the response to 1
+ Synergism: 2 amplifies response to 1
