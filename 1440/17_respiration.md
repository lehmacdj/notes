# Respiration and the respiratory system

+ Diffusion depends on solute concentration
+ Gasses also diffuse.
    + Their diffusion is limited by pressure rather than concentration

## Diffusion of gases
+ The gas law: PV = nRT
+ Computes partial pressure of all things
+ Law of partial ::= sum of all partial pressures is total pressure

### Different gasses
+ CO2 is more soluble than O2.
+ This requires the use of hemoglobin

### Partial pressure in action!!!
+ There is a partial pressure of gas inside of the liquid as well
+ An equilibrium is established

### Bubbles
+ Insects can eat oxygen from bubble and then more O2 diffuses into the bubble
  from water in a lake / pond

## The human respiratory system
+ O2 needs to be delivered to tissues
+ CO2 needs to be disposed of

1. Diffusion into blood
2. bulk transport via blood
3. diffusion into muscles

### The physiological oxygen cascade
+ Determines the direction of O2 diffusion
+ Partial pressure O2 in decreasing order in body:
    + Ambient air
    + Alveolar gas
    + Artery blood
    + Average blood
    + Mitochondria
        + Very low because this is where the O2 is consumed
+ This helps move O2 to the mitochondria from the air

+ The reason
    + Pressure is highest near source
    + Lowest near the sink

### Ventilation
+ O2 Uptake directly related to flow rate and efficiency of the exchange

### Strategies for exchanging air
+ Cocurrent / Counter current air exchange
+ Tidal air exchange (Humans)
+ Huge amounts of surface area (Humans)
+ Some air is always stuck in the lungs

### Control of Breathing
+ Pre-Botzinger complex is a region of the medulla that drives ventilation
+ In the Medula of the lower brain
