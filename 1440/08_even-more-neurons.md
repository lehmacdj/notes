# Neurobiology 4
+ Note: These notes are kind of vague, reading the lecture slides may be a good
  idea

## Conduction Speed of Neurons
+ Larger diameter axons tend to have faster conduction speed
    + Bigger axon diameter = faster transportation speed
    + Bigger axon diameter = longer length constant
        + r_m decreases with diameter
        + r_i decreases with square of diameter

## Vertebrates strategy
+ Myelination increases action potential conduction velocity
    + Axons are wrapped in myelin
    + These **Myelin sheaths** are made by glia
        + Made of Oligodendrocytes in the Central Nervous System 
        + Schwann cells in the Peripheral Nervous System
+ This results in way faster axons relative to their size

## Myelination increases conduction velocity
+ Myelination increases r_m by a 1000 - 10,000 fold factor
+ Current flows through the shortest path
+ Since r_m is increased λ increases
+ but what effect does this have on τ (the time constant)?
    + τ = c_m * r_m
    + myelination dramatically increases the distance between the plates
    + c_m decreases (~1000 fold)
    + Consequence leads to increasing λ, without changing τ

### Myelination Fibers
+ Action potential is salatory
    + Action potentials are only able to work at the Nodes of Ranvier
        + These are gaps in the myelin sheath where Na+ channels can be found

### Getting message across
+ Our nervous system is not a syncytium
+ Consists of individual cells
+ Messages pass from axon to axon

## Synapses
+ Two main varieties
    + Electrical synapses
        + cells are effectively connected
    + Chemical synapses
        + Cells separated by 20 - 30 nanometers

### Chemical Synapses
+ Neurotransmitter carries the signal between the pre/post-synaptic cells
+ Advantage
    + Easy to modulate
+ Disadvantage
    + Information flows in only one direction
    + Slow
        + electrical signal to chemical signal
            + Neurotransmitter has to be released into the gap
            + The transmitter triggers protiens on the membrane of the
              postsynaptic cell
    + Postsynaptic potentials are:
        + Small (< 1 mV)
        + Transitory (short)
        + Graded - the size varies
        + Passive - nonregenerative
        + Postsynaptic potentials can be
            + Excitatory or 
            + inhibatory

#### Postsynaptic potentials
+ There are two types of postsynaptic potentials
    + Exitatory
    + Negative
+ Many in a short time is good

#### A single action potential isn't large enough
+ Temporal summation
    + Several potentials in a short period of time
+ Spatial summation
    + Lots of potentials in a short amount of space


### Neuromuscular junction
+ Serves as a model system for studying chemical synapses
    + Why?
        + Easy access
        + Each muscle fiber is innervated by a single neuron
        + Large post-synaptic response
        + Simple structure

### Presynaptic Terminals
1. AP enters the presynaptic ending
2. Inflowing current triggers Ca^2+ channels
3. [Ca2+]\_i increases
4. Fusion
