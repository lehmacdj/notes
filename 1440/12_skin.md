# Skin!!!!!!!!!!
+ The biggest sensory organ

## Receptors
+ Human skin has tons of different types of sensors
+ Do lots of different things
+ an important one is hair
+ A large array of stuffs
+ They are bundled into the spinal cord

#### Different types of properties
+ *Tonically* responding cells produce spikes as long as stimulus continues
    + Merkel disk
    + Ruffini ending
+ *Phasically* responding cells generate spikes when the stimulus changes
    + Meisner corpuscle
    + Pacinian corpuscle

## Intensity response function
+ Intensity response function isn't linear. There are three phases:
    + Threshold - Beginning slow increase with increased stuff
    + Log linear - greatest slope
    + Saturation - action potentials overloaded

## Spatial properties
+ Receptors in the skin are organized spatially and each neuron has a receptive
  field
+ With a deep press there is not much that helps you know where the contact is
+ With a shallow touch there is a much more accuracy in determining the location
+ Spatial ambiguity is compared by comparing multiple different receptors things
+ Different regions have different levels of accuracy

##### Dermatomes
+ A region of the skin that all enters the central nervous system from the same
  area

+ Different things travel at different speeds
    + Pain, temperature, itch travels the slowest
    + Then Touch
    + Then limb position

+ When a thing is poked other things are inhibited
+ This helps make everything be a lot more exact
+ Some things are extremely overrepresented in the cortex of organisms
+ The area of the brain that keeps track of tactile stuff keeps track of motion
+ Brain affects opposite side of the body
+ Playing an instrument uses lots of feedback from lots of different types of
  nervous input
