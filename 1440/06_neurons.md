# Neurons
+ integration of systems
+ animals are more than a loose collection of cells
+ integration is required in order to ensure proper function
    + Thermoregulation
    + drive to seek food and water
    + mating

## Integrations and Control systems

### Cell-cell signaling
+ Refers to the integration of information from:
    + Sensory system
    + central nervous system (CNS from here on out)
    + Endocrine system
+ These are specialized structures for cellular signalling and communicating
    + CNS is very fast, electrical currents
    + endocrine system slower, chemical transport of signals

### Neuron Doctrine
+ Nervous systems consist of two types of cells
    + neurons
        + cells specialized for long distance cellular communication
    + Glia are support cells
        + Provide nutrients
        + Help remove neurotransmitters
        + Alter the conductive properties of axons
            + Schwann cells
+ Neurons are outnumbered by Glial cells

### The Structure of Neurons
+ Dendrites
    + The input region of the neuron
    + The receiving end of the input of the synapse of the cell
+ Cell body
    + Also acts as an input site
    + Has points of integration for synaptic potentials
+ Axon
    + Long thin thingy
    + Allows for longer distance communication
+ Presynaptic terminal
    + At the end of the axon
    + Is the other component of the synapse
+ Neurons transmit information using an electrical action potential

#### Size of Neurons
+ Axons are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals over distances
  measuring from microns to meters
    + In a giraffe neurons are extremely long
    + In a tiny tick they are very small on the scale of Microns

#### Speed of Neurons
+ Neurons are very very fast.
+ Up to 100 impulses per second
+ Speeds of 20 - 100 m/s
+ Top speed of an action potential is arround 240 kph

#### How are these properties possible?
+ Axons are capable of carrying many electrical signals very rapidly
+ The signal jumps from one neuron to another (across the membrane)
    + This can be chemical
    + or electrical
+ Post synaptic terminals receives chemical or electrical signals

#### Neural Circuits
+ A group/network of neurons that control a discrete (separate / distinct)
  response or behavior
+ The circuit is conceptually easy
    + Afferent Neurons are sensory
    + Central neurons are an integration center
    + efferent neurons transmit control signals to target cells (e.g. muscles)

```
sensory neuron -> central neuron -> motor neuron -> muscle
```

### Passive Membrane Properties Determine Membrane Potential
+ Membrane voltage or V_m = the electrical potential at the inner surface
  relative the outer surface of the membrane
+ This is derived from electrical force and diffusion
+ Basically an electrochemical gradient on the cell membrane
+ V_m is the potential to do work when ions are allowed to flow across the
  membrane

#### Measuring V_m
+ Electrodes
    + Microelectrodes allow the measuring of V_m from inside of the cell
    + A reference electrode is placed outside of the cell
+ A voltmeter is used to record the potential across the cell membrane
+ V_m is measured in mV
    + The Resting membrane potential is about 40mV to 80 mV
    + Every kind of cell actually has this membrane potential

#### Membrane Passive properties
+ Different properties of membranes play an important role in determining V_m
+ Membrane resistance R_m
    + the specific membrane resistance measured per unit of membrane
    + inversely related with permeability
+ Based on Ohm's law one would expect Resistance to be the only important factor
+ Experiments however determine that this is not he case
+ The curve should be square shaped if it follows ohm's law
+ *however:* instead it has lag
+ Change in V_m lags and needs to change slowly
+ The delay must be due to sever constants

#### Time Constant
+ C_m is the storage of charge across the membrane
    + This quantity is measured in terms of Farads
+ Some charge can be stored in the membrane
+ the Time constant tau = C_m * R_m
+ In passive membranes C_m and R_m are stable
+ Delay is due to C_m and R_m
    + Ions and their charge is stored across the membrane
        + The phospholipid bilayer is nonconductive
    + It takes time to charge the parts of the cell.
    + Ion channel allows ions to diffuse across the membrane
    + Result: Fewer ions available to give the membrane charge
    + The channel makes the ions leave as soon as they enter the cell
      effectively

#### Length Constant
+ You inject a current pulse into an axon
+ The current spreads along the length of the axon
+ Maximum size of the voltage change diminishes with distance from the
  injection site.
+ Distance at which the input drops is 35% lambda
+ At any given point along the length of the axon the number of available (or
  the density of) charges determines the maximum change in membrane potential
+ What factors influence changes in the density of hte charges with the distance
  of the axon.
+ Lambda depends on the membrane resistance and internal resistance of the axon
+ A little about resistors
    + In series the sum of the resistors
    + In parallel sum of reciprocals
    + Current flows through the shortest path
    + shortest path = r_m (because it is the lowest resistive path)
+ lambda = sqrt (r_m / r_i)
+ The longer the axon the higher the resistance of that material total
+ Through the cell is like in series
+ Out of the cell is like in parallel
+ As the current gets further away there is less charge because the charge
  escapes the cell
+ Reducing either the internal resistance increases `lambda`, decreasing the
  membrane resistance decreases `lambda`
+ The resting membrane potential (V_m)

#### The membrane resting potential
+ At rest K+ channels are leaky
+ Na+ Channels tend to be closed at rest
+ Most molecules e.g. A- (generic anion) cannot cross the membrane

##### The key point
+ A very small number of ions are responsible for generating a -90 mA V_m

+ V_m is determined by
+ Passive diffusion
+ Active transport
+ Without Na+-K+-ATPase with time the Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients
  would slowly decrease, K+ slowly leaks out of the cell and an excess of Na+
  develops in the cell

##### Chlorine
+ There is very little chlorine inside of the cell because it driven out of the
  cell by anions inside of the cell
    + The excess of anions inside the cell is mostly proteins...
    + Acid anions etc.

#### Net equilibrium or Nernst Potential of an Ion
+ like E = E + RT/nF ln Q
+ In biology we abbreviate this as:
    + E_x = 62mV log ([x]outside / [x]inside)
+ This equation can be used to approximate the amount a certain ion is important
  in establishing equilibrium
+ Based on the Nernst equation it was determined that 
    + K is primarily responsible for the V_m
    + This is logical since it is one of the most 

#### The Goldman equation
+ Describes the relative contribution of multiple ions on the resting membrane
  potential based on differences in their ion permeability
