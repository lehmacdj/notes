# Neurons
+ integration of systems
+ animals are more than a loose collection of cells
+ integration is required in order to ensure proper function
    + Thermoregulation
    + drive to seek food and water
    + mating

## Integrations and Control systems

### Cell-cell signaling
+ Refers to the integration of information from:
    + Sensory system
    + central nervous system (CNS from here on out)
    + Endocrine system
+ These are specialized structures for cellular signalling and communicating
    + CNS is very fast, electrical currents
    + endocrine system slower, chemical transport of signals

### Neuron Doctrine
+ Nervous systems consist of two types of cells
    + neurons
        + cells specialized for long distance cellular communication
    + Glia are support cells
        + Provide nutrients
        + Help remove neurotransmitters
        + Alter the conductive properties of axons
            + Schwann cells
+ Neurons are outnumbered by Glial cells

### The Structure of Neurons
+ Dendrites
    + The input region of the neuron
    + The receiving end of the input of the synapse of the cell
+ Cell body
    + Also acts as an input site
    + Has points of integration for synaptic potentials
+ Axon
    + Long thin thingy
    + Allows for longer distance communication
+ Presynaptic terminal
    + At the end of the axon
    + Is the other component of the synapse
+ Neurons transmit information using an electrical action potential

### Passive Membrane Properties Determine Membrane Potential

### time constant

### length constant
