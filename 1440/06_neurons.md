# Neurons
+ integration of systems
+ animals are more than a loose collection of cells
+ integration is required in order to ensure proper function
    + Thermoregulation
    + drive to seek food and water
    + mating

## Integrations and Control systems

### Cell-cell signaling
+ Refers to the integration of information from:
    + Sensory system
    + central nervous system (CNS from here on out)
    + Endocrine system
+ These are specialized structures for cellular signalling and communicating
    + CNS is very fast, electrical currents
    + endocrine system slower, chemical transport of signals

### Neuron Doctrine
+ Nervous systems consist of two types of cells
    + neurons
        + cells specialized for long distance cellular communication
    + Glia are support cells
        + Provide nutrients
        + Help remove neurotransmitters
        + Alter the conductive properties of axons
            + Schwann cells
+ Neurons are outnumbered by Glial cells

### The Structure of Neurons
+ Dendrites
    + The input region of the neuron
    + The receiving end of the input of the synapse of the cell
+ Cell body
    + Also acts as an input site
    + Has points of integration for synaptic potentials
+ Axon
    + Long thin thingy
    + Allows for longer distance communication
+ Presynaptic terminal
    + At the end of the axon
    + Is the other component of the synapse
+ Neurons transmit information using an electrical action potential

#### Size of Neurons
+ Axons are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals over distances
  measuring from microns to meters
    + In a giraffe neurons are extremely long
    + In a tiny tick they are very small on the scale of Microns

#### Speed of Neurons
+ Neurons are very very fast.
+ Up to 100 impulses per second
+ Speeds of 20 - 100 m/s
+ Top speed of an action potential is arround 240 kph

#### How are these properties possible?
+ Axons are capable of carrying many electrical signals very rapidly
+ The signal jumps from one neuron to another (across the membrane)
    + This can be chemical
    + or electrical
+ Post synaptic terminals receives chemical or electrical signals

#### Neural Circuits
+ A group/network of neurons that control a discrete (separate / distinct)
  response or behavior
+ The circuit is conceptually easy
    + Afferent Neurons are sensory
    + Central neurons are an integration center
    + efferent neurons transmit control signals to target cells (e.g. muscles)

```
sensory neuron -> central neuron -> motor neuron -> muscle
```

### Passive Membrane Properties Determine Membrane Potential

### time constant

### length constant
