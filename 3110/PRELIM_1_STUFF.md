1. Small step semantics

2. Infer type expressions
    - Modules are types so are fair game
    - No first-class modules on the exam

3. Implement a few modules based on specs

4. Reals. Write down the definition of addition, subtraction, etc.
    - No multiplication either

5. Programming logic

```
let proof x = fun g -> fun b -> match x with
  | L a -> g a
  | R b2void -> b2void b
```
