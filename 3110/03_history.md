# History of OCaml
+ LCF - logic of computable functions
+ ML - meta language
    + program proofs in lcf
    + the proof should only use the rules of lcf
+ Different proof assistants
    + NUPRL
    + HOL - higher order language
    + COQ
+ Type system
    + `type proof`
    + everything could use that type
    + if it typechecks it is a correct proof
    + type safety
+ CAML
+ OCAML
