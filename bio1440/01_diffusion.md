# Diffusion
+ Objectives for the day
    + Cell membranes & epithelia are barriers to diffusion
    + understand the physical perimeters that influence simple diffusion
    + understand the differences between the diffusion of charged and uncharged
      solutes
+ Typical cell
    + more [Na+]out than [Na+]in
    + more [Cl-]out than [Cl-]in
    + less [K+]out than [K+]in
+ Why don't the cells move toward equilibrium?
    + cells must be selectively permeable
    + The membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell
    + The basic function of the cell membrane is to isolate/ protect the cell
      from its surrounding environment
+ How can we derive this outcome?
   + Let us break the membrane down to its molecular components.

## Composition of the cell membrane 
+ Membrane composed of a bilayer of phospholipids
+ Proteins and carbohydrates are embedded in the bilayer

### Phospholipid
+ A lipid with an attache phosphate group
+ phospholipids are amphipathic
    + consist of a polar and nonpolar region
        + the charged polar head is hydrophilic
            + therefore gather on hte outside of the water
        + the nonpolar tails are hydrophobic
            + therefore aggregate in the center
                + This is a consequence of the phospholipid tails stopping the
                  water from forming hydrogen bonds
                + The tails are more stable when they are not near the water
    + the two regions are joined by a glycerol molecule

+ The phospholipids in the bilayer is fluid
+ phospholipids slip and slide past each other rapidly
+ about 10^7 times per second they swap places
+ about once a month phospholipids flip to the other side of the membrane
+ Membrane saturation / water fluidity
    + double bonds = less saturation
        + leads to a more fluid membrane
        + more like an oil
    + single bonds = more saturation
        + leads to a less fluid membrane
        + more like butter
+ Membrane fluidity is dependent on temperature
    + as an adaptive solution animals that live in colder environments have a
      higher amount of unsaturated pphospholipids
+ phospholipids in the bilayer are fluid
    + gaps open and close
    + serve as a route for free diffusion
+ water molecules therefore get a way to go through the membrane
+ small and weakly polarized molecules can pass through the membrane
+ what is the maximum size for diffusion?
    + Glucose is roughly the size but cannot really pass through
+ Simple diffusion of non-charged molecules
+ substances diffuse down their concentration gradient
    + does not require energy
+ closed systems move toward equilibrium or the state of the minimum capacity to
  do work
+ please note cells and organisms are open systems
    + this means that mass can be added or removed from it

### Fick's Diffusion Equation
+ Complex variant

```
J = D((C1 - C2) / X)
where
J:= the amount of substance that flows (per unit area per unit time)
D:= the diffusion coefficient
C1 - C2:= the difference in concentration between the solute at two locations
X:= distance separationg regions of high and low concentration
D:= empirically determined for each solute pair
```

+ Simpler variant: for cell membranes

```
J = P (C1 - C2)
where 
P is the membrane permeability constant for a substance
```

+ For certain compounds
    + Albumin - too big
    + estrogen - a steroid and therefore fatty so it passes right through the
      cell membrane
    + water can pass through but not very effectively
    + H+ is very small and can therefore pass through easily
