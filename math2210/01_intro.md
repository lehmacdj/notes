#Linear equations
variables: x, y, z, s, t
           x1, x2, x3, ...

eg: 3x + 5y - 3z = 23
    2x + 3y = 6

+ easily solvable for a single variable
+ usually not solvable for an exact solution
+ systems of equations make them solvable for the variables

## possibilities for a system of equations
1. no solutions
2. exactly one solution
3. infinite solutions
