# Introduction
## Linear equations
variables: x, y, z, s, t
           x1, x2, x3, ...

eg: 3x + 5y - 3z = 23
    2x + 3y = 6

+ easily solvable for a single variable
+ usually not solvable for an exact solution
+ systems of equations make them solvable for the variables

### possibilities for a system of equations
1. no solutions
2. exactly one solution
3. infinite solutions

### how to solve -- basic approach
1. use one equation to solve for a variable
2. substitute into the second equation
3. solve for the other variable
4. find the first variable

### modify the system to an equivalent sytem
+ equivalent systems have the same solutions

#### operations
+ swap the order of the equations
+ multiply the equation by non-zero number
+ add multiple of one equation to another

#### how to solve using this approach
1. visualize how to eliminate variables from the equations
2. use operations to reduce equation to make a matrix where each only contains a single variable

+ order doesn't matter
+ either way one will get the same solution
+ if one equation evaluates to true the system has infinitely many solutions
+ if one equation evaluates to false the system has no solutions

#### notation
variables can be removed to make solution easier

coeficient matrix (only contains coefficient not a complete equation:

[ 1 1 1 ]

[ 2 -1 1 ]

[ 1 0 1 ]

augmented matrix (contains coefficients and constant terms equivalent to the system):

[ 1 1 1 | 6 ]

[ 2 -1 1 | 3 ]

[ 1 0 1 | 9 ]

opperations can be done on these in much the same way as the system of equations
