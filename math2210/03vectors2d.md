#Vectors
+ a vector is two numbers
+ use **v** and **w**
+ vectors are bold or have an arrow over them
+ two ways of writing
    + (a, b)
    + [a \ b]
+ order matters
+ addition: just add the two components
+ multiplication by scalar: just multiply the components
+ we can not multiply two vectors
    + dot product
    + cross product

## Axioms
1. Addition is commutative: **v** + **u** = **u** + **v**
2. Addition is associative: (**v** + **u**) + **w** = **v** + (**u** + **w**)
3. there is a zero vector
4. there is a negative vector for every vector: **u** + -**u** = 0 
5. distributive property of vectors: a(**u** + **v**) = a**u** + a**v**
6. distributive property of scalars: (a + b)**u** = a**u** + b**u**
7. multiplication of scalars is commutative: a(b**u**) = (ab)**u**
8. one times a vector does nothing
9. zero times a vector = the zero vector
0. -1 times a vector gives a negative vectors

##Linear combination
+ given a list of vectors one multiplies each vector by a weight and then adds them
+ (4,5,6) is a linear combination of (1,2,3) and (1,1,1)
+ to determine that this is true one has to solve a system of equations
+ one can create a matrix from the vectors of a linear combination
+ that matrixes solutions represents whether the vectors form a linear combination
+ vectors that form a linear combination all lie in the same plane
    + they are said to be in the same span
    + to find out solve the matrix
    + iff there are no pivots in the last column the system has a solution
