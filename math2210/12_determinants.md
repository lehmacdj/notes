#Determinants
+ a property of a matrix
+ a scalar value
+ A is invertible if and only if det A â‰  0
+ The bottom right hand corner of the matrix times some factor
+ row reduction can be done to arive at this state.

##The 3 * 3 Determinant
+ product elements in the 3 diagonals from botom right to top left minus the elements in the diagonals from the bottom left to the top right

##Covariant expansion
+ an alternate method to find det of a matrix
+ recursive approach
+ works down any row or column

## For diagonal matrixes
+ det T = the product of the diagonals

## Facts about determinants
+ det(AB) = detA * detB
+ det(A^T) = det(A)
+ if E is an elementary matrix detE is easy to compute
    + this means that row reduction can be used to more easily compute the determinant of a matrix
