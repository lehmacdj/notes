# Cornell Notes
This github repository is where I keep the notes that I write for my classes at
Cornell University.  I think it is a good way to take notes because they are
readable anywhere once they have been pushed to github.

I have decided however to put a larger emphasis on taking notes by hand and am
therefore not updating this repository very frequently.

This semester I am taking:
+ CS 3110
+ CS 2800
+ CHEM 3590
+ BIO 1440
+ BIO 1500
