# Cornell Notes
This github repository is where I keep the notes that I write for my classes at Cornell University.  I think
it is a good way to take notes because they are readable anywhere once they have been pushed to github and


I think it would be really cool if more people going to classes at Cornell would contribute to this to make
a large repository of notes for many classes at Cornell.  This would become a very useful resource for many
students.

If you are interested in contributing you can send pull requests here or email me and perhaps I will add you
as a contributor for this repository.

This semester I am taking:
+ CS 2110
+ CHEM 2150
+ MATH 2210
+ ENGL 1167

I am not taking notes for ENGL 1167 for this class since it is a writing seminar and seminar based.
