# Cornell Notes
This github repository is where I keep the notes that I write for my classes at Cornell University.  I think
it is a good way to take notes because they are readable anywhere once they have been pushed to github and


I think it would be really cool if more people going to classes at Cornell would contribute to this to make
a large repository of notes for many classes at Cornell.  This would become a very useful resource for many
students.

If you are interested in contributing you can send pull requests here or email me and perhaps I will add you
as a contributor for this repository.
